# Nordigen Ruby Library

This is official Ruby client library for [Nordigen](https://nordigen.com/en).

For a full list of endpoints and arguments, see the [docs](https://nordigen.com/en/account_information_documenation/api-documention/overview/).

Before starting to use API you will need to create a new secret and get your `SECRET_ID` and `SECRET_KEY` from the [Nordigen's Open Banking Portal](https://ob.nordigen.com/user-secrets/).

## Requirements

* Ruby 2.6+


## Installation


Install library

```
gem install nordigen-ruby
```

## Example application

Example code can be found in `main.rb` file and Ruby on Rails example application can be found in `example` directory

## Quickstart


```ruby
require 'securerandom'
require 'nordigen-ruby'

# Get secret_id and secret_key from ob.nordigen.com portal and pass to NordigenClient or load from .env file
client = Nordigen::NordigenClient.new(
  secret_id: "SECRET_ID",
  secret_key: "SECRET_KEY"
)

# Generate new access token. Token is valid for 24 hours
token_data = client.generate_token()

# Use existing token
client.set_token("YOUR_TOKEN")

# Get access and refresh token
# Note: access_token is automatically injected to other requests after you successfully obtain it
access_token = token_data["access"]
refresh_token = token_data["refresh"]

# Exchange refresh token. Refresh token is valid for 30 days
refresh_token = client.exchange_token(refresh_token)

# Get all institution by providing country code in ISO 3166 format
institutions = client.institution.get_institutions("LV")

# Institution id can be gathered from get_institutions response.
# Example Revolut ID
id = "REVOLUT_REVOGB21"

# Initialize bank authorization session
# Returns requisition_id and link to initiate authorization with a bank
init = client.init_session(
  # redirect url after successful authentication
  redirect_url: "https://nordigen.com",
  # institution id
  institution_id: id,
  # a unique user ID of someone who's using your services, usually it's a UUID
  reference_id: SecureRandom.uuid
)

link = init["link"] # bank authorization link
requisition_id = init["id"] # requisition id that is needed to get an account_id
puts link
```

After successful authorization with a bank you can fetch your data (details, balances, transactions)


## Fetching account metadata, balances, details and transactions

```ruby

# Get account id after you have completed authorization with a bank.
requisition_data = client.requisition.get_requisition_by_id(requisition_id)
# Get account id from list
account_id =  accounts["accounts"][0]

# Instantiate account object
account = client.account_api(account_id)

# Fetch account metadata
meta_data = account.get_metadata()
# Fetch details
details = account.get_details()
# Fetch balances
balances = account.get_balances()
# Fetch transactions
transactions = account.get_transactions()
```

## Development

Run all tests in a directory
```bash
ruby -Itest tests/tests.rb
```
